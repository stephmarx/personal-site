"Accessibility: It's Not Just a Client Side Problem" is aimed at anyone in tech who has only a basic familiarity with accessibility and who might think that it's something that only front end developers need to concern themselves with. In this talk, I explain the basics of accessibility, why it's important, guidelines for creating accessible technology, and the adaptive technologies that many people use.
