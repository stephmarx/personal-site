# [fit] No, You Don't Need to Know My Sex:
### Gender Bias in Form Design
### **with Stephanie Slattery**


^ note that this talk is focused on the way we talk about gender and sex in North America, indigenous cultures and other areas of the world talk about gender differently

---

## How should you ask about
## sex and gender in forms?

---

### **Spoiler alert: Don't do it.**

^ but first! an aside about sex and gender!

---

# Sex != Gender

^too often are sex and gender used interchangeably
"male and female" are sex words, not gender (like man or woman)

---

# [fit] Sex
A biological (but not binary) distinction between male and female. This can be anatomical, hormonal, and/or chromosomal.

^ Many people are intersex, and there research that suggests that about 1 in 150 people are intersex. That's about as common as red hair or green eyes.
^ https://intersexroadshow.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/how-common-is-intersex-status.html

---

# [fit] Gender
How a person identifies and/or expresses themselves. It may or may not be related to their biological sex.

---

## So, how should you ask
## about this stuff?


---

## If you must ask,
# [fit] ask the right question.

---

## If you must ask,
# [fit] give the right options.

---

## If you must ask,
## explain why.

^ many people who are members of a sex or gender minority can be confused or upset by being asked. what will they do with this info? should i lie to stay safe? is it worth outing myself?

---

### How to ask about a person's sex:
# you shouldn't.

^ Unless you are working on a medical website that needs to know about body parts or hormones or chromosomes, you should not be asking about this. If you are, consult with relevant medical professionals.

---

# Sex:
- Female
- Intersex
- Male

^ Approach recommended by the Intersex Society of North America http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex

---

### How to ask about a person's gender:
# [fit] you (probably) shouldn't.

^ Does a law require you to know someone's legal gender? Do your advertising partners require it? You should only ask when it's absolutely necessary, and be prepared to keep that information secure and ask for it without judgement.

---

# Gender identity:
- an open text field

^ yes, you will have to sanitize and process this data. poor you.
^ if you really need specific, easy-to-collect data, include specific options followed by an open text field
^ okay, so you've realized you don't need to know gender or sex, but you feel like you need something related. ask yourself:

---

# [fit] Are you actually interested
## in pronouns?

---

# Pronouns
- she/her/hers
- they/them/theirs
- ze/hir/hirs
- he/him/his
- Something else

^ If you must, give a set of examples in radio buttons with a "something else" option which labels an open text box. "Other" can make your user feel, well, othered.

---

### Or do you just need to
# [fit] know their formal title?


^ if you need to refer to someone more formally, always ask for a title. provide options and a "something else" radio button
^ important to remember: you can't infer sex or gender or pronouns from a title.

---

- Sex
- Gender
- Pronouns
- Formal title

^ so we've talked about...
^ two important things to remember:

---


## Always randomize the
## order of your options.

^ you want to avoid the appearance of hierarchy

---

## Take only the data you absolutely need.

^ it's dangerous to ask someone to out themselves, and you're asking about really personal information.

"When a website is considered “good,” whatever that website displays as default settings... or  options is considered “normal” by its users."
- Sarah Dopp

^ is a web project manager and gender diversity advocate

^ when you give inclusive options, your users will see that inclusivity as normal, and treat other people in the world with more empathy and inclusiveness.
