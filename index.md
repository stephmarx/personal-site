    I'm a web developer in Chicagoland who specializes in front end, accessibility, and user interface design. Currently, I'm employed as a Front End Developer at Adage Technologies in the Loop. I also sling code for a variety of gaming groups in the Chicago area, including Northwestern's Dead City Productions and Ask Again Later, an independent roleplaying chronicle.  
    <br><br>
    I come to the world of programming from a psychology and physics background at the Illinois Institute of Technology and am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp Chicago. In my free time, I can be found running roleplaying games, creating glitch art, or taking my cat on walks.
