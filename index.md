    I'm a web developer in Chicagoland who specializes in front end, accessibility, and user interface design. Currently, I'm employed as a Front End Developer at <a href="https://www.adagetechnologies.com">Adage Technologies</a> in the Loop and previously worked as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer. In my spare time, I'm a core contributor to several open-source applications used by gaming groups in Chicagoland, including Northwestern's Dead City Productions and <a href="http://www.askagainlater.com/">Ask Again Later</a>, an independent roleplaying chronicle.
    <br><br>
    I come to the world of programming from a psychology and physics background at the Illinois Institute of Technology and am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp Chicago. I'm particularly passionate about the intersection of code and design and love when I can function as an interpreter between those two areas of expertise. I specialize in accessibility on the web and have led audits and accessibility projects for several clients.
    <br><br>
    In my free time, I can be found running roleplaying games, creating glitch art, or taking my cat on walks.
