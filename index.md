      I exist at the intersection of web engineering, storytelling, and empathy. I educate and empower others to make the world a better place through mentoring, workshops, conference talks, podcast episodes, zines, and articles. I believe that the best way to include people of marginalized identities is to sit down and listen; and that the best way to ensure a safer future for people with identities like my own is to stand up and yell.
