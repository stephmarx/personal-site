Snapshot is a [200 word RPG](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) and a demake of [a certain N64 photography-based video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap). Snapshot is a live-action roleplaying game (LARP) for two players.

One player is the Professor, who knows declares a route for the photographer, scores their photos, and knows a lot about everything. The other player is the Photographer, who ventures into the world trying to take the best photos of animals, people, and even objects that they can.

Gameplay should take roughly an hour, including deciding a route, the photography, and judging the photos.
