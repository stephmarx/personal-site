Roughly 1 in 5 people in America live with a disability and legal actions against inaccessible sites are becoming more and more common. It would be irresponsible to ignore the needs of all our users when developing for the web, so why don't we design accessible sites to begin with? In this talk, I'll explain the basics of web accessibility, including the guidelines you should be following, the adaptive technologies commonly in use, and help you better advocate for users with disabilities in your work.
