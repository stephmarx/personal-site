### A hackathon website, May 2015
#### [View on Github](https://github.com/wiliajc87/humblehearts/tree/development) | [Live Site](http://www.humbleheartsfoundation.org/)

<p>A website donated to the Humble Hearts Foundation and constructed during the Nerdery Overnight Website Challenge. This site was created in just 24 hours by a team of ten developers, all graduates of Dev Bootcamp. I worked as a front-end developer for this project, working with our designer to finalize the user interface. I also adapted the original designs for mobile and helped architect the initial back end of the application.</p>
<p>This site uses Ruby on Rails, HTML5, SCSS, and jQuery.</p>
