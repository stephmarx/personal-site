### A 200 word LARP about an awful meeting.

#### [Download on itch](https://sublimemarch.itch.io/brand-actualization)

<br>

Brand Actualization is a single page live-action roleplaying game for 6-10 people (and one rebranding consultant) about an awful meeting. As a player, you will create a highly opinionated character wanting their ideas to be included in their company's rebranding. The game is over when either an hour has passed or a physical fight has broken out.

Based on this [absolutely astonishing Pepsi rebranding document](https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/pepsi-arnell-021109.pdf). Created for the [Redesign Your Logo jam](https://itch.io/jam/redesign-your-logo).
