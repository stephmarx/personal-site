Roughly ten percent of people have a disability that directly impacts their use of digital technologies, and lawsuits against inaccessible websites are becoming more and more common. The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508 require us to build accessible technology for people with disabilities, but that shouldn't be our primary driver for being inclusive of all users. How can we move beyond seeing accessibility as a legal requirement, and into championing inclusion for people with disabilities? In this talk, I'll discuss additional motivations for building accessible technology and how to help build empathy for the cause of accessibility within your organization.
