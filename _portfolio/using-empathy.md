As a new developer, it's tough to stand out from the pack of junior developers with similar skills to you. In this talk, I'll share my story of how I stood out from other junior devs by caring about digital accessibility, and how you can use the things you care about to be appealing to employers. You don't have to be the best, and you don't have to know a lot, you just need to care and want to learn more.
