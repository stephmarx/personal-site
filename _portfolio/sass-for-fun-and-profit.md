Ugh, CSS, it seems like it has a mind of its own and feels super complicated for anything more than a simple layout. If only there was some way to apply the best parts of programming to it, like variables or functions, and make things better. Enter: Sass, an extension of CSS that makes writing your stylesheets fun and easy. In this talk, I’ll introduce the basics of Sass: variables, nesting, mixins, and importing. We’ll discuss both of the available syntaxes for Sass and work through some ways to improve existing CSS using the magic of Sass. Bring your laptop to code along! This talk assumes basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, and is a great place to start for people just starting to feel the headaches of writing pure CSS.
