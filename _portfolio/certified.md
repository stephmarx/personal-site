### An consumer-facing web app, June 2015 to June 2016
<p>My first project in my Software Developer role at Underwriters Labs, which was a redesign of the legacy Online Certifications Directory. The Certifications Directory is a publicly available repository of all current UL certifications. Our redesign included enhanced search capabilities, an completely new user interface, and a bookmarking feature. This redesign went through an alpha and beta user testing process, and this user feedback was rolled into future projects which further reenvisioned the certifications directory.</p>
<p>This was completed in a team of two other Rails developers, of which I was the lead front end developer. The app consists of two Ruby on Rails applications, one serving an API and the other containing a user database and the web front end. This application uses Ruby on Rails, SLIM, Sass, and jQuery. The Foundation framework is used, as well as the Datatables gem.</p>
