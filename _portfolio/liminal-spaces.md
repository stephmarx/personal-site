### An 8-page (or single sheet) zine about liminal spaces.
#### [Download on itch (pay what you want)](https://sublimemarch.itch.io/liminal-spaces)

<br>

A mini, 8-page zine about the places I find most comforting and inhabitable: liminal spaces. Using my own photos and few words, I evoke hotel rooms, subway cars, and planes.

Created for the [weekend mini-zine jam](https://itch.io/jam/weekend-mini-zine-jam-1).

I've provided the print version of the zine, which requires some simple folding and cutting. [Here](https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/05/how-to-make-a-zine/) [are](http://experimentwithnature.com/03-found/experiment-with-paper-how-to-make-a-one-page-zine/) some guides on how to assemble it.
