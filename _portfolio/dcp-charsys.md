### A web app, August 2015 - October 2015
#### [View on Github](https://github.com/deadcity/charsys) | [Live Site](http://characters.deadcityproductions.com/login)

<p>Myself and a team of two other developers created the character creation and management system used by Dead City Productions, which is a live-action roleplaying group based out of Northwestern University. This application uses Ruby on Rails, SLIM, Sass, and significant amounts of jQuery. The Foundation framework is used, as well as the Datatables gem.</p>
<p>I led the design of the user interface for this site, including user flow maps and mockups. I assisted in back-end coding and database design of this site, and mentored another developer in learning Ruby on Rails as part of this project. As of March 2017, I am involved in active maintenance and enhancement for this site.</p>
